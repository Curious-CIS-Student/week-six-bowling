# week-six-bowling
Contains test code for Bowling Kata

## The Bowling Kata

The goal for this week is to study test driven development using the Bowling Kata.  Attached is a powerpoint slide that walks through the steps to build and test a program that will score a set of given rolls for a bowling program.

When finished, you should be able to run a set of test rolls against the scoring program and it should successfully return the score given in the file.
